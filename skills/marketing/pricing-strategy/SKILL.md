# Pricing Strategy Guide

## Pricing Models

### One-Time Purchase
- **Best for:** Desktop software, physical goods, courses
- **Pros:** Simple, high upfront revenue
- **Cons:** No recurring revenue, harder to update

### Subscription (SaaS)
- **Best for:** Software, services, content
- **Pros:** Predictable revenue, ongoing relationship
- **Cons:** Higher churn risk, constant value delivery needed

### Freemium
- **Best for:** Products with network effects, low marginal cost
- **Pros:** Low barrier to entry, viral potential
- **Cons:** Conversion optimization critical, free users cost money

### Usage-Based
- **Best for:** APIs, infrastructure, utilities
- **Pros:** Fair, scales with customer success
- **Cons:** Unpredictable revenue, complex billing

### Hybrid
Combine models: Free tier + paid upgrades + usage fees

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
Show expensive option first to make others seem reasonable.

### Charm Pricing
$99 feels significantly cheaper than $100 (left-digit effect).

### Decoy Effect
Add an inferior option to make target option more attractive.
```
Basic: $10/mo (5 features)
Pro: $25/mo (15 features)    ← Target
Business: $100/mo (20 features)
```

### Price-Quality Signal
Higher price can signal higher quality (luxury goods, consulting).

## Tier Structure

### Standard 3-Tier Model
| Tier | Target | Features | Pricing |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Free/Basic | Individual, trial | Core features, limits | $0 or low |
| Pro | Power users, small teams | Full features | Mid-range |
| Enterprise | Companies | Custom, support, SLA | High/custom |

### Feature Gating Strategies
- **Quantity limits:** 3 projects free, unlimited paid
- **Feature access:** Advanced features paid only
- **Support level:** Community vs priority
- **Collaboration:** Single user vs team

## Pricing Frameworks

### Value-Based Pricing
1. Identify customer's alternative (competitor, DIY, nothing)
2. Quantify value your product provides
3. Price at fraction of value delivered (typically 10-30%)

### Cost-Plus Pricing
```
Price = Cost + Margin
```
Simple but ignores value and competition.

### Competitive Pricing
Price relative to competitors:
- Premium: 20-50% above
- Parity: Same range
- Discount: 20-50% below

## Common Mistakes

1. **Pricing too low** - Undervalues product, attracts wrong customers
2. **Too many tiers** - Confuses buyers, analysis paralysis
3. **Free tier too generous** - No reason to upgrade
4. **Complex pricing** - Hidden fees erode trust
5. **Never raising prices** - Leaving money on table

## Price Testing

### A/B Testing Pricing
- Test landing page positioning, not actual prices (legal issues)
- Test willingness to pay surveys
- Test conversion at different price points sequentially

### Willingness to Pay Survey
1. "At what price would this be too expensive?"
2. "At what price would this seem too cheap (low quality)?"
3. "At what price is this starting to get expensive?"
4. "At what price is this a bargain?"
