# Page Conversion Optimization (CRO)

## Initial Assessment

Before optimizing, understand:
1. **Page type** - Homepage, landing, pricing, feature, blog?
2. **Conversion goal** - Signup, purchase, contact, download?
3. **Traffic source** - Ads, organic, referral, direct?
4. **Current metrics** - Conversion rate, bounce rate, time on page?

## Core Analysis Framework

### 1. Value Proposition (Above the Fold)
- Can visitors understand what you offer in 5 seconds?
- Is the benefit clear, not just features?
- Does it match the ad/link that brought them?

**Test:** Show page for 5 seconds, ask "What does this company do?"

### 2. Headline Effectiveness
- States clear benefit or outcome
- Addresses visitor's problem
- Specific > vague
- Short enough to scan

**Bad:** "Welcome to Our Platform"
**Good:** "Send 10x More Emails Without Getting Marked as Spam"

### 3. CTA (Call to Action)
- Above the fold AND repeated below
- Action-oriented verb ("Start Free Trial" not "Submit")
- Stands out visually (contrast color)
- Reduces friction (no signup vs long form)

**Weak:** "Submit" / "Learn More"
**Strong:** "Start Free Trial" / "Get My Report"

### 4. Visual Hierarchy
- Eye path guides to CTA
- Important info in F/Z pattern
- White space guides attention
- Mobile-optimized layout

### 5. Trust Signals
- Customer logos (if B2B)
- Testimonials with photos/names
- Review scores (G2, Capterra)
- Security badges (if payment)
- "As seen in" press logos

### 6. Objection Handling
- FAQ section
- "What if" concerns addressed
- Money-back guarantee
- Free trial/freemium option

### 7. Friction Removal
- Minimal form fields
- No unnecessary steps
- Clear next steps
- Fast page load
