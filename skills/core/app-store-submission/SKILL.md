# App Store Submission Skill

**Triggers:** app store, app store connect, privacy declaration, data tracking, app submission, iOS submission, app review

## Context

This skill activates when working on App Store Connect submissions, particularly privacy declarations and data collection forms.

## Key Learnings from Past Sessions

### Privacy Declarations

1. **AI Apps and Third-Party Content**: If your app uses AI (like Claude/OpenAI), it DOES "contain, show, or access third-party content" since AI responses are generated by external services.

2. **Data Tracking Definition**: Tracking specifically refers to:
   - Linking user data with third-party data for targeted advertising
   - Sharing data with data brokers
   - Sharing IDs with ad networks for retargeting

   **NOT tracking:**
   - Data linked solely on the user's device
   - Data used for first-party analytics only
   - Fraud prevention or security purposes

3. **Data Linking to Identity**: Data is considered "linked to identity" unless you:
   - Strip direct identifiers before collection
   - Manipulate data to prevent re-linkage
   - Use aggregation techniques

### Common Gotchas

1. **UI Changes**: App Store Connect's layout changes frequently. Don't assume sections exist based on documentation - verify against actual screenshots.

2. **In-App Purchases Location**: The In-App Purchases section may not appear on the main app page - it could be under different navigation paths depending on your app's configuration.

3. **Data Collection Categories**: Select ALL applicable data types your app collects. Common ones for apps with auth:
   - Name (if users have profiles)
   - Email Address (if used for login)
   - User ID (if you track logged-in users)
   - Crash Data (if using crash reporting)

### Privacy Labels Workflow

1. **First Question**: Does your app collect data?
   - If app has ANY user accounts, analytics, or crash reporting: Yes

2. **Data Types Selection**: For each type, you'll answer:
   - Is it linked to user identity?
   - Is it used for tracking purposes?

3. **For Apps with User Auth**:
   - Name: Usually linked, not for tracking
   - Email: Linked if used for login, not tracking unless shared with ad networks
   - User ID: Linked by definition, not tracking unless shared externally

4. **For Apps using AI**:
   - User Content: May be collected (prompts/inputs)
   - Consider what you send to AI APIs

## Best Practices

1. **Be Conservative**: When in doubt, disclose more rather than less
2. **Document Decisions**: Keep records of why you answered each question
3. **Review Third-Party SDKs**: Each SDK may collect additional data
4. **Update Regularly**: Review privacy labels when adding new features or SDKs

## Example Answers for Common App Types

### App with Firebase Auth + AI Features
- **Collects data**: Yes
- **Email Address**: Yes, linked to identity, not for tracking
- **Name**: Yes (if displayed), linked to identity, not for tracking
- **User ID**: Yes, linked to identity, not for tracking
- **User Content**: Yes (AI prompts), linked to identity, not for tracking
- **Crash Data**: Yes (if using Crashlytics), linked to identity, not for tracking
- **Third-party content**: Yes (AI responses)

### App with Analytics Only
- **Collects data**: Yes
- **Device ID**: Yes, not linked (if using anonymized analytics)
- **Usage Data**: Yes, not linked, not for tracking
- **Crash Data**: Yes, not linked, not for tracking
